// Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does
//This program will print my name in lowercase, uppercase and title case
var myname = "uRooJ";
console.log(myname.toLowerCase());
console.log(myname.toUpperCase());
console.log(myname.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + myname.slice(1).toLowerCase());
