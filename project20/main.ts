// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let cities = ['karachi' , 'lahore' , 'islamabad' , 'peshawar' , 'quetta' , 'rawalpindi']

console.log('Cities I like most: ', cities)
